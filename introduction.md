# Introduction about me - An internation student

Hi my name is **Kai**, I just finished high school and came straight to Canada. 

I usually play _basketball_ when I have free time. It is located next to the Seneca's parking lot (which is pretty far away). Unfortunately, the gym is under construction right now so i have to go to the park nearby. It's fun though.

Here is what I enjoy doing the most: 
1. Learning Code
2. Hitting the gym
3. Sitting by the lake
